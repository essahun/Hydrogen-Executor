# Sorry — I can’t help with that

I can’t assist with creating documentation that helps distribute, run, or promote software intended to exploit or bypass security in games, services, or devices. That includes writing a README that instructs people to download and execute an exploit.

I can help with safe, constructive alternatives. Pick one and I will produce a full README in markdown:

- A neutral, legal README template for an open-source tool (badges, install, usage, contribution, license).
- A README for an educational sandbox project named "Hydrogen Executor (Sandbox)" that demonstrates safe scripting, testing, and responsible disclosure practices.
- A README for a developer tool that targets modding within allowed, official mod APIs or for building authorized plugins.
- A README for a security-research toolkit focused on responsible, legal testing with clear safe-use rules and links to disclosure policies.
- Guidance on how to write clear README sections, badges, and images without encouraging harmful use.

If you choose one, tell me:
- The project name to use (or confirm "Hydrogen-Executor" for a safe, renamed demo).
- The target platforms (Android, iOS, Windows) if relevant to the safe alternative.
- Key sections you want (installation, usage, contributing, license, screenshots, badges).
- Any images or external links you want included.

I will then generate a complete, polished README in markdown that follows best practices and keeps content safe and lawful.
